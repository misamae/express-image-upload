  <h1 class="jumbotron">Brief Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    We have developed models and tools for object recognition as well as detection in an image. While in a  recognition scenario, an image is assigned to one of pre-defined classes, in detection, the machine looks for and locates various occurrences of certain objects of interest within an image. For object/image recognition, our engine categorises an image into one of more than thousand classes, whereas in detection, we have considered two examples of "Car" and "Pedestrian" detection. These models are of particular interest in various real-life applications such as driving assistance, surveillance, visual content search, etc. Our models are trained on a large number of training data, collected from real-life scenarios and shown to perform well in realistic situations. The model for "Car" detection, spots instances of various types of cars in an image and provides a bounding box with a confidence level for each detection. The pedestrian detection model is trained to locate pedestrians within an image, enclose their locations with bounding boxes where each box is associated with a confidence level. Typical examples of Car and Pedestrian detection instances are visualised in the images below.

    Our models are based on the so-called artificial neural networks. These models are constructed as a stack of multiple layers of operations. The image is fed to the first layer of the model which is then passed through subsequent layers and finally result in a higher level abstraction of image content. Deep neural networks, which are composed of a large number of layers, are shown to surpass many exising approaches in visual perception. A particular sub-category of deep neural networks called Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) possess certain degrees of robustness against inconsistent imaging conditions. All our models are constructed as deep CNNs.
    While our models operate in different daylight conditions including sunny, clowdy, etc. they can tailored to suit a specific condition such as snow, night, etc or even extend to spot other objects of interest in an image or video sequence. We provide solutions for object recognition as well as detection which operate in real-time and can be deployed on a desktop machine or as an embedded module with small dimensions and very low power consumption profile.
